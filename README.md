## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Live App (Recommended)

Simply visit **[https://avisangle.github.io/make-twitter-oauth/](https://avisangle.github.io/make-twitter-oauth/)** in your browser and start using the wizard immediately!

### Option 2: Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avisangle/make-twitter-oauth.git
   cd make-twitter-oauth
   ```

2. **Open in browser:**
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```
   Or simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your default browser.

3. **No build process required!** - Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before using this tool, you need:

1. **Twitter Developer Account**
   - Create an app at [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard)
   - Get your Client ID and Client Secret
   - Set redirect URL to: `https://www.make.com/oauth/cb/oauth2`

2. **Make.com Account**
   - Free account at [Make.com](https://www.make.com)
   - Ability to create and import scenarios

## 🎯 How It Works

### Step 1: Enter Credentials
- Input your Twitter app's Client ID and Client Secret
- PKCE parameters (code_verifier, code_challenge) are auto-generated using SHA-256

### Step 2: Review PKCE Parameters
- View the generated security parameters
- System prepares the authorization URL

### Step 3: Authorize with Twitter
- Click to open Twitter authorization in a new tab
- Log in and authorize the application
- Copy the redirect URL (even though it shows "Resource not found" - this is expected!)

### Step 4: Complete Setup
- Paste the redirect URL
- Auth code is automatically extracted
- Scenario JSON downloads immediately with pre-filled auth code
- Import to Make.com and run within 30 seconds!

## 📦 Generated Scenario

The auto-generated Make.com scenario includes 3 modules:

1. **Set Variable** - Stores the pre-filled authorization code
2. **HTTP Token Exchange** - Exchanges auth code for OAuth tokens (access_token, refresh_token)
3. **Twitter Post** - Posts a test tweet: "Testing Twitter API integration with Make.com! 🚀"

### Key Technologies

- **OAuth 2.0 with PKCE** - Secure authorization flow
- **Web Crypto API** - SHA-256 hashing for code_challenge
- **Make.com Blueprint** - JSON scenario format
- **Twitter API v2** - OAuth and tweet endpoints
- **Pure Vanilla JS** - No frameworks or dependencies

### Security Features

- ✅ PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) implementation
- ✅ Secure random string generation
- ✅ State parameter for CSRF protection
- ✅ No credentials stored or transmitted to third parties
- ✅ Client-side only processing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Resource not found" error on redirect
- **This is normal!** Make.com doesn't have a page at the redirect URL
- Simply copy the entire URL from the address bar

### Authorization code expired
- Auth codes expire in 30 seconds
- Return to Step 3 and re-authorize
- Download the new scenario and import immediately

### Scenario import shows validation errors
- Ensure you're using the latest downloaded scenario
- Check that all HTTP parameters are included (they should be auto-generated)
